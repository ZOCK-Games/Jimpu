#Jimpu

Jimpu is a simple 2D Jump 'n' Run.
It is in early development and
not near finished. I will try my best
to make it a fun game.

#🚧 Development Status 🚧

It is at version 0.1. It will release
when it reaches 1.0.

#⚙️ Future ⚙️

I want the game to be free and public.
As it is my first game that I made, I want
at least 5 levels and a full working shop +
inventory system so you can buy items.
